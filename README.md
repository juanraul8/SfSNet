### Overview
 - (0) Test script: `test_SfSNet.m`, `test_SfSNet.py`
 - (1) Test images along with mask: Images_mask
 - (2) Test images without mask: Images
 
Run 'test_SfSNet' on Matlab or 'test_SfSNet.py' in Python to run SfSNet on the supplied test images. 

### Dependencies ###
This code requires a working installation of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and Matlab interface for Caffe or Python interface for Caffe. For guidelines and help with installation of Caffe, consult the [installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and [Caffe users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users).

Please set the variable `PATH_TO_CAFFE_MATLAB`, in line 3 of `test_SfSNet.m` as `$PATH_TO_CAFFE/matlab` (path to matlab folder for the caffe installation)

### Notes
We detect keypoints on the face using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00851">All-in-One Network</a> and compute a mask from it. Unfortunately the code is not distributable. Ideally, you can use any keypoint detector and generate a mask based on the facial contour.

For the ease of use, we include a matlab function `functions/create_mask_fiducial.m` which computes a mask given keypoints. The keypoint definitions are shown in `functions/facial_landmarks_68markup-768x619.jpg`. [Dlib C++ Library](http://dlib.net/) can be used to detect 68 keypoints based on this definition.

### Training Code
We provided neccessary .prototxt training and solver files, along with python loss layers needed to train SfSNet. Please check `SfSNet_train` for more details.

### Training Data
We provide [250k synthetic face images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UQONt9Usk3PKztSIoXeNUEUqD5s6z69e/view?usp=sharing) with Ground-Truth normal, albedo and lighting at 512x512 resolution generated with [3DMM](http://gravis.dmi.unibas.ch/Sigg99.html). Caution the file size is ~120GB. This data is provided only for research purposes.

##### Note: Please fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/lLTaT4KYgGQAmBhh2) to request access to the synthetic data.

For real data, please download the aligned and cropped [CelebA face dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).
